The DALI PHY and microcontroller board. Handles all DALI-bus communication (IEC 62386-101/102 compatible), protocol processing, and generates the digital PWM/LED control signals. Built around the CH32V003F4U6 RISC-V microcontroller (20-pin QFN, 48 MHz, 16 KB Flash, 2 KB RAM).

The PHY transceiver converts between the DALI bus voltage levels (0/16V) and the MCU's 3.3V logic. See [`../Simulations/`](../Simulations/) for LTspice reference designs (isolated and non-isolated variants).

**Digital LED output** (WS2812/SK6812 modes): SPI1_MOSI on PC6 at 3 MHz, DMA-driven. Same physical pin as TIM1_CH1 — selected at compile time via `EVG_MODE_xxx`.

> **⚠ Galvanic isolation is MANDATORY.** AC-mains switching of the 250 W load board was tested on real hardware: the LED-power domain **must be galvanically isolated** from the DALI/MCU domain. The isolation barrier lives on the **load board**. The J4 ribbon connector is the controller↔load-board interface that feeds the isolator's input side.

## J4 — Load-board interface (10-pin FFC, 0.5 mm pitch)

Pins 9 and 10 are dual-function (PWM **or** SPI), selected by the controller's `EVG_MODE` at compile time — so the same connector drives either a direct-PWM load board or a digital (SPI) load board with no controller hardware change:

| Pin | Net | MCU pin | Function |
|-----|-----|---------|----------|
| 1 | `GND` | — | Controller-domain ground (DALI/MCU side; isolated from LED domain on the load board) |
| 2 | `+3V3-D` | — | 3.3 V controller-domain supply (feeds the isolator input side VCC1 in Route A) |
| 3 | `SCK` | PC5 | SPI1 clock (digital load board) |
| 4 | `SDA` | PC1 | I²C data (shared EEPROM bus; load-board diagnostics option) |
| 5 | `SCL` | PC2 | I²C clock |
| 6 | `PSU-CTRL` | PA2 | LED AC/DC PSU enable — HIGH = on (also used as AUX-MCU power-cycle / bootloader entry in Route B) |
| 7 | `PWM_CH4` | PD3 | White PWM (free in SPI mode) |
| 8 | `PWM_CH3` | PC0 | Blue PWM (free in SPI mode) |
| 9 | `PWM_CH2 / MISO` | PC7 | Green PWM **or** SPI MISO (load-board → controller, e.g. diagnostics) |
| 10 | `PWM_CH1 / D_LED / MOSI` | PC6 | Red PWM **or** WS2812/SK6812 data **or** SPI MOSI |
| M ×2 | `GND` | — | Connector mounting / shield tabs |


The connector is deliberately over-provisioned, because **one controller is meant to serve many generations of load board.** Each load board taps only the signals it needs, and the firmware selects the matching mode at compile time via `EVG_MODE` — so adopting a new load-board design is a recompile, not a controller respin. Power (`+3V3-D`, `GND`) and the `PSU-CTRL` enable line are always present; what varies from board to board is *how the colour and level data is actuated.*

**I²C (`SDA`/`SCL`) is always routed**, shared with the controller's on-board EEPROM bus. It is held in reserve for a future diagnostic/measurement channel (LED current, temperature, fault feedback) or an I²C PWM/LED expander.

> ⚠ **One caveat on isolating I²C.** I²C is *bidirectional*, so taking it across the galvanic barrier requires a bidirectional I²C isolator — those are typically mA class parts which might crash the 2mA current budget.

For the actuation itself, each load board picks **one** of three paths:

1. **Direct PWM** — the four 20 kHz channels (CH1…CH4) drive the load-side gate drivers straight through the isolator. The simplest option, but it needs a fast enough isolator so that even the shortest dimming pulses survive the barrier intact. Tested is the π160M30 from 2Pai-Semi.
2. **Addressable LED (WS2812 / SK6812)** — a single-wire data stream on the CH1/MOSI pin, generated by SPI1 + DMA.
3. **SPI to a load-side companion MCU** — the unidirectional SPI lines isolate cleanly with a cheap **µA** digital isolator. A second MCU on the load board, powered locally from the LED PSU, acts as an **SPI slave**: it receives colour/level commands and handles everything downstream itself — optional diagnostics returned over MISO. A slow and inexpensive isolator suffices, and the bus-side channel count stays minimal.

*Example SPI mapping* — a 6-channel isolator (e.g. 2Pai π161U3x, 5 forward + 1 reverse), reusing the otherwise-PWM pins:

| Dir | Signal | J4 | MCU |
|-----|--------|----|-----|
| → | MOSI | 10 | PC6 |
| → | SCK | 3 | PC5 |
| → | NCS | 8 | PC0 |
| → | PSU-CTRL | 6 | PA2 |
| → | BL-Enable | 7 | PD3 |
| ← | MISO | 9 | PC7 |

> Note: the π161U3x (U-Grade) limits the SPI-Speed to 150kHz. In case of availability issues the higher grades (M/E) are also OK. 

**Firmware updates** happen over the DALI bus itself via the IEC 62386-105 bootloader at `0x1FFFF000`. PA1 held low at reset routes into the bootloader (works for POR, NRST, and SYSRESETREQ thanks to the firmware-side `boot_button_check()`). PD1 (SWDIO) is the recovery path via WCH-LinkE for chips that have lost their flash content entirely.

##### DALI RX Waveform

Oscilloscope capture of the raw Manchester-encoded signal on PC3 (DALI RX, via PHY transceiver). C1 is the raw 16V DALI Signal, C2 is the signal after the receiver on PC3.

##### C24 Voltage Stability

Voltage across C24 (DALI bus power supply decoupling) while rapidly sending DALI commands over an extended period. The voltage must remain above **12.5V** to ensure the circuit works at the lowest allowed DALI bus voltage (9.5V).

**Calculation:** The DC-DC converter requires a minimum of 5V input. The bridge rectifier drops ~1V (2 diodes). So C24 must stay above 6V for the converter to regulate. At the minimum DALI bus voltage of 9.5V, this allows a maximum voltage drop of 3.5V (9.5V - 6V). Our test supply runs at 16V, so the equivalent pass/fail threshold is 16V - 3.5V = **12.5V**. If C24 stays above 12.5V at 16V supply, it will stay above 6V at 9.5V supply. Note: this is a linear approximation — actual energy stored in C24 scales with V², so the real margin at 9.5V will be slightly worse. Best estimate for now until tested at actual minimum bus voltage.

**Measurement procedure:** DALI EVG firmware (RGBW mode) running on the target. An OpenKNX DALI gateway sent continuous broadcast QUERY GEAR PRESENT (0xFF 0x91) frames at maximum bus rate (~32 frames/sec, 25ms spacing per IEC 62386-101) for 5 seconds (~160 frames total). Oscilloscope probe on C24, DC coupling, 2V/div, 50ms/div timebase, min/max measurement enabled.

**Result (2026-05-02):**
- Bus supply voltage: 16V
- Maximum at C24: **15.4V**
- Minimum at C24: **14.8V**
- Voltage drop: **0.6V** (well within 3.5V budget)
- **PASS** — extrapolated minimum at 9.5V bus: ~8.9V (above 6V threshold)


**3.3V rail (after buck converter):**
- No traffic: 3.63V max / 3.44V min
- Under sustained traffic (32 fps): 3.63V max / 3.42V min
- **Stable** — only 20mV additional ripple under load. CH32V003 operating range is 2.7–5.5V, so 3.42V is well within spec.

Note: All Channels have different V/div settings.<br>
C1: DALI bus, you can see sustained heavy traffic. C2: Voltage at Capacitor C24 (before the Buck). C3:. Voltage at 3.3V Rail after the Buck.

### Current Consumption

Total current draw of the Controller board with firmware running. Target: < 2 mA to stay within DALI bus power limits.

**Measurement (2026-05-02):** 100R shunt resistor in series with the supply. DALI EVG firmware (RGBW mode) running, bus idle, Bus Voltage 16V. Measured 169mV across the shunt → **1.69 mA**. Well within the 2 mA DALI bus power budget.
