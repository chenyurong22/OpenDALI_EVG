## Boards

### Controller

The DALI PHY and microcontroller board. Handles all DALI-bus communication (IEC 62386-101/102 compatible), protocol processing, and generates the digital PWM/LED control signals. Built around the CH32V003F4U6 RISC-V microcontroller (20-pin QFN, 48 MHz, 16 KB Flash, 2 KB RAM).

The PHY transceiver converts between the DALI bus voltage levels (0/16V) and the MCU's 3.3V logic. See `Simulationen/` for LTspice reference designs (isolated and non-isolated variants).

**PWM channel mapping** (TIM1 Partial Remap 1, `AFIO_PCFR1_TIM1_REMAP = 01`):

| Channel | Pin | LED colour (RGBW mode) |
|---------|-----|----------------------|

| TIM1_CH2 | PC7 | Green |
| TIM1_CH3 | PC0 | Blue |
| TIM1_CH4 | PD3 | White |

**Digital LED output** (WS2812/SK6812 modes): SPI1_MOSI on PC6 at 3 MHz, DMA-driven. Same physical pin as TIM1_CH1 — selected at compile time via `EVG_MODE_xxx`.

**USB** (bootloader only): PD4 (D+), PD2 (D-), PD0 (DPU). Active only when boot button (PA1) is held low during reset. Do NOT connect USB while the EVG is on a DALI bus.

##### DALI RX Waveform

Oscilloscope capture of the raw Manchester-encoded signal on PC3 (DALI RX, via PHY transceiver) during a broadcast QUERY GEAR PRESENT (0xFF 0x91) frame. 0.50V/div, 2ms/div. Signal swings 0V to 3.7V with clean edges. The 16-bit forward frame (start bit + 16 data bits) is clearly visible with correct 1200 baud timing (~833µs per bit period).

##### C24 Voltage Stability

Voltage across C24 (DALI bus power supply decoupling) while rapidly sending DALI commands over an extended period. The voltage must remain above **12.5V** to ensure the circuit works at the lowest allowed DALI bus voltage (9.5V).

**Calculation:** The DC-DC converter requires a minimum of 5V input. The bridge rectifier drops ~1V (2 diodes). So C24 must stay above 6V for the converter to regulate. At the minimum DALI bus voltage of 9.5V, this allows a maximum voltage drop of 3.5V (9.5V - 6V). Our test supply runs at 16V, so the equivalent pass/fail threshold is 16V - 3.5V = **12.5V**. If C24 stays above 12.5V at 16V supply, it will stay above 6V at 9.5V supply. Note: this is a linear approximation — actual energy stored in C24 scales with V², so the real margin at 9.5V will be slightly worse. Best estimate for now until tested at actual minimum bus voltage.

**Measurement procedure:** DALI EVG firmware (RGBW mode) running on the target. An OpenKNX DALI gateway sent continuous broadcast QUERY GEAR PRESENT (0xFF 0x91) frames at maximum bus rate (~32 frames/sec, 25ms spacing per IEC 62386-101) for 5 seconds (~160 frames total). Oscilloscope probe on C24, DC coupling, 2V/div, 50ms/div timebase, min/max measurement enabled.

**Result (2026-05-02):**
- Bus supply voltage: 16V
- Maximum at C24: **14.84V**
- Minimum at C24: **14.40V**
- Voltage drop: **0.44V** (well within 3.5V budget)
- **PASS** — extrapolated minimum at 9.5V bus: ~9.06V (above 6V threshold)


**3.3V rail (after buck converter):**
- No traffic: 3.63V max / 3.44V min
- Under sustained traffic (32 fps): 3.63V max / 3.42V min
- **Stable** — only 20mV additional ripple under load. CH32V003 operating range is 2.7–5.5V, so 3.42V is well within spec.

##### Current Consumption

Total current draw of the Controller board with firmware running. Target: < 2 mA to stay within DALI bus power limits.

**Measurement (2026-05-02):** 100R shunt resistor in series with the supply. DALI EVG firmware (RGBW mode) running, bus idle, Bus Voltage 16V. Measured 169mV across the shunt → **1.69 mA**. Well within the 2 mA DALI bus power budget.
