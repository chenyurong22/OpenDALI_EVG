# DALI-2-compatible EVG Firmware

DALI-2-compatible control gear (slave) firmware for the **CH32V003F4U6** RISC-V microcontroller, built on [cnlohr's ch32fun](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun) framework. Drives up to 4 PWM channels (RGBW) with full IEC 62386 protocol support, DT8 colour control, and flash persistence — all in under 10 KB of code.

> Trademark notice — see [root README](../README.md): *DALI*, *DALI-2* etc. are DiiA trademarks; this project is an independent IEC 62386 implementation, not DiiA-certified.

## EVG Modes

The firmware supports 8 LED output modes, selected via a single `EVG_MODE_xxx` define in `hardware.h` (or `-DEVG_MODE_xxx` compiler flag). All internal configuration (DALI device type, channel count, driver, DT8 features) is derived automatically.

![EVG Mode Feature Matrix](evg_mode_switch.png)

| Mode | DT | Channels | Driver | Tc | Primary | Flash |
|------|-----|----------|--------|-----|---------|-------|
| `EVG_MODE_ONOFF` | 6 | 0 | PSU_CTRL only | - | - | 8.6 KB |
| `EVG_MODE_SINGLE` | 6 | 1 PWM | TIM1 | - | - | 9.3 KB |
| `EVG_MODE_CCT` | 8 | 2 PWM | TIM1 | yes | no | 10.4 KB |
| `EVG_MODE_RGB` | 8 | 3 PWM | TIM1 | yes | yes | 10.5 KB |
| `EVG_MODE_RGBW` | 8 | 4 PWM | TIM1 | yes | yes | 10.6 KB |
| `EVG_MODE_WS2812` | 8 | 3 (GRB) | SPI+DMA | yes | yes | 11.0 KB |
| `EVG_MODE_SK6812_RGB` | 8 | 3 (GRB) | SPI+DMA | yes | yes | 11.0 KB |
| `EVG_MODE_SK6812_RGBW` | 8 | 4 (GRBW) | SPI+DMA | yes | yes | 11.1 KB |

Default: `EVG_MODE_RGBW`. ONOFF mode compiles out all LED drivers, log table, and TIM1 — only PSU_CTRL (PA2) switches on/off. PHY_MIN = 254 (any non-zero arc level → full on). SINGLE mode compiles out all DT8 code (~1 KB savings).

## Features

- **IEC 62386-101** — Manchester-encoded physical layer at 1200 baud with DALI PHY transceiver, bus collision detection
- **IEC 62386-102** — Full DALI protocol: addressing, arc power, fading, scenes, groups, configuration
- **IEC 62386-209 (DT8)** — RGBW colour control with colour temperature (Tc) support
- **Logarithmic dimming** — IEC 62386-102 compliant 254-step lookup table
- **Flash persistence** — All configuration survives power cycles (deferred write with 5s debounce)
- **On/off mode** — PSU_CTRL-only relay/switch output, no timers or PWM
- **20 kHz PWM** — 4 channels via TIM1 with 2400-step resolution (11.2 bit)
- **WS2812/SK6812 support** — Alternative digital LED output via SPI1+DMA on PC6

## What Doesn't Work / Not Implemented

| Memory bank 1 + write access | Read-only bank 0 only; writable banks not implemented |
| DALI-2 diagnostic queries (166-175) | Require hardware monitoring circuitry (current/voltage sensing) |
| CIE xy chromaticity | Requires per-LED spectral calibration |
| ENABLE DAPC SEQUENCE (cmd 9) | Rarely used, complex timing |
| Tc temperature limits (store/query) | Not yet implemented |
| controlGearFailure / lampFailure status bits | Require hardware monitoring (I2C ADC planned) |

## Build & Flash

```bash
pio run                    # Build
pio run -t upload          # Flash via PlatformIO
# or directly:
wlink flash .pio/build/genericCH32V003F4P6/firmware.bin
```

## Bulk Provisioning of Blank EVGs (`flash_blank_evg.ps1`)

`flash_blank_evg.ps1` runs the full first-time provisioning sequence in a loop and is the one-stop tool for programming blank CH32V003-based EVG boards.

For every chip it performs:

1. Bootloader (`Bootloader/dali_bootloader.bin`) → `0x1FFFF000` (boot area, 1920 B fixed)
2. configurebootloader (`Bootloader/configurebootloader.bin`) → `0x08000000` (runs once, writes the option bytes that enable boot-from-bootloader)
3. Firmware (PlatformIO `pio run -t upload`) → `0x08000000` (overwrites configurebootloader)
4. Verify option bytes by reading `0x1FFFF800` and `FLASH_OBR` (`0x4002201C`):
   - `RDPR == 0xA5`, `RDPR + ~RDPR == 0xFF`
   - `USER == 0xEF`, `USER + ~USER == 0xFF`
   - `OPTERR == 0`, `RDPRT == 0`, `STARTMODE == 1`

The loop polls `wlink status` once per second; when a CH32V003 is detected it runs all four steps and prints **PASS** (green) with the elapsed time, or **FAIL** (red) with the failing step. After completion it waits for the chip to be disconnected before accepting the next one. **ESC** exits cleanly. On hosts that don't support raw-key polling the loop falls back to **Ctrl+C**.

### Prerequisites

- **WCH-LinkE programmer** connected to the host
- **PlatformIO CLI** installed at `%USERPROFILE%\.platformio\penv\Scripts\platformio.exe` (default location)
- **wlink** at `%USERPROFILE%\.platformio\packages\tool-wlink\wlink.exe` (installed automatically by the `ch32v` PlatformIO platform)
- Pre-built artefacts present:
  - `../Bootloader/dali_bootloader.bin` (build via `Bootloader/build.bat` once)
  - `../Bootloader/configurebootloader.bin` (shipped with the bootloader)
- The script auto-builds the firmware via `pio run -t upload` — no separate build step needed

### Usage

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File flash_blank_evg.ps1
```

Connect chips one by one. Typical wall-clock time per chip: **~8 seconds**.
