    dali_bank0.h - DALI memory bank 0 (read-only gear identification)

    IEC 62386-102:2014 §4.3.10 mandates a read-only memory bank 0 that
    identifies the control gear: GTIN, firmware/hardware version, serial
    number, supported standard versions, number of logical units. The
    master accesses it via the READ MEMORY LOCATION command (cmd 197),
    using DTR1 = bank number, DTR0 = address within bank (see IEC §9.8).

    This implementation provides only bank 0 (read-only); bank 1 and
    write access are out of scope. The byte layout below follows the
    most common DALI-2 interpretation of §4.3.10. Field offsets and
    sizes should be cross-checked against the spec version your master
    expects (a few field widths shifted between -102:2009, -102:2014,
    and -102:2014/A1:2018).

    Build-time customisation:
      DALI_FW_VERSION_MAJOR / _MINOR  — firmware version reported in bank 0
      DALI_HW_VERSION_MAJOR / _MINOR  — hardware revision reported in bank 0
      DALI_GTIN_BYTES (optional)      — 6-byte GTIN, MSB first
    These can be defined in hardware.h or via -D on the compiler line.
    GTIN and serial default to all-zero placeholders.
